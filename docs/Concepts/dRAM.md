# decentralized Random Access Memory (dRAM)

The **decentralized Random Access Memory (dRAM)** is a concept introduced in Topology Protocol and is supported by the following features present in the protocol:

**1. Random access**: Users have the option to synchronize on the CROs of their interest without having to synchronize with all the CROs in the system.

**2. Closeness to compute**: Most CRO-powered applications users will operate node on their devices, having local CRO replicas, making this property similar to the role that Random Access Memory (RAM) serves in a memory hierarchy.

**3. Ephemerality**: The protocol expects the nodes to be ephemeral, so there's no persistence in CROs. This makes the data movement between Topology nodes and persistence providers similar to the data movement between RAM and diosk storage.

So, nodes implementing the Topology Protocol form an ephemeral P2P network that keep CRO states next to local compute on the edge, working as a decentralized Random Access Memory (dRAM).
