The **LWW-Register** stores an element with a timestamp associated with each update. The timestamps are used to check if a write happened before or after the current timestamp stored in the register. So when performing an update, the LWW-Register checks if the update's timestamp is greater than the stored timestamp, and if it is the LWW-Register is updated, else it is not.
