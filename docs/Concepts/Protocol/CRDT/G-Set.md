# G-Set (Grow-only Set)

The **G-Set** is a set that only allows to add elements. So, if an element is added to the G-Set, it cannot be removed. It has a **lookup** function to check if an element is in the set. The **merge** operation is the union of two G-Sets.

The G-Set is useful as a building block for more complex constructions.
