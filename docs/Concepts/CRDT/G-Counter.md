# G-Counter (Grow-Only Counter)

The G-Counter implements a counter that only **increments**. It has an array ***P*** of **n** nodes, each one identified by their ID, that stores the counter values of each node.

Our G-Counter implementation supports both **operation** and **state** changes. The **merge** function is **commutative**, **associative** and **idempotent** and it will compute the **maximum** of every element in ***P***.

One useful application of a G-Counter is, for example, counting the number of votes on a P2P poll.
