# PN-Counter

The **PN-Counter** combines **two G-Counters**, one for **increment** and another one for **decrement**. The value of the PN-Counter is the increment counter minus the decrement counter. This might lead to having large vectors, so to avoid this only **super-peers** should replicate the counter.

A PN-Counter might be useful to track the number of users logged in to an P2P application.
